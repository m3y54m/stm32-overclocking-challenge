# STM32 Overclocking Challenge

This repository contains my solutions to [a challenge on Sisoog website](https://sisoog.com/2023/09/28/%d9%85%d8%b3%d8%a7%d8%a8%d9%82%d9%87-%d9%87%d9%81%d8%aa%d9%85-%d8%b3%db%8c%d8%b3%d9%88%da%af/).

## Challenge Statement

**Write a program for the STM32F103C8T6 microcontroller to toggle the PC14 pin at the highest possible frequency.**

The program should meet the following criteria:

- The program that achieves the highest frequency on PC14 will be considered the winner.
- The generated signal on PC14 should maintain the same frequency for a minimum of 10 minutes.
- It is recommended to use a [Blue-Pill board](https://stm32world.com/wiki/Blue_Pill) as the hardware for this challenge. If required, you are allowed to replace the crystal on the board.
